# OO Analysis #

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used. 

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes ##
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development". 


### _Conceptual Class Category List_ ###

**Business Transactions**

* Test

---

**Transaction Line Items**

* Sample

---

**Product/Service related to a Transaction or Transaction Line Item**

## **Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes** ##

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations: 

+ **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
+ **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
+ **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
+ **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
+ **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
+ **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
+ etc.




| Concept (A) 		|  Association   	|  Concept (B) |
-|----------	   		|:-------------:		|------:       |
| Client   | Recieves | Report |
| Clinical chemistry technologist  |   Is  		 	| Employee  |
|                                  |   Works at     | Company's headquarters   |

|                                  |   Record       | Results               |
| Laboratory coordinator  |   Is           | Employee                |
| Many Labs	   		|   Has             | Employees     |
| Medical Lab Technician  |   Is             | Employee           |

| Receptionist       |   Is              | Employee    |
|            		|   Works at   		| Clinical analysis laboratories       |
|                   |   Interacts with  | Client |
| Specialist doctor           |   Is           | Employee  |
