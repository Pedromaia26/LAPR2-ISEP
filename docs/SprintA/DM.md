# OO Analysis #

The construction process of the domain model is based on the client specifications, especially the nouns (for _concepts_) and verbs (for _relations_) used. 

## Rationale to identify domain conceptual classes ##
To identify domain conceptual classes, start by making a list of candidate conceptual classes inspired by the list of categories suggested in the book "Applying UML and Patterns: An Introduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design and Iterative Development". 


### _Conceptual Class Category List_ ###

**Business Transactions**

* Test

---

**Transaction Line Items**

* Sample

---

**Product/Service related to a Transaction or Transaction Line Item**

* Diagnosis
* Parameter

---


**Transaction Records**

* Report of the samples

---  


**Roles of People or Organizations**


* Receptionist
* Medical lab technician
* Courier
* Clinical chemistry technologist
* Specialist doctor
* Laboratory coordinator
* Client
* Administrator

**Places**

* Clinical analysis laboratories
* Chemical laboratory
* Company's headquarters

---

**Other External/Collaborating Systems**

*  NHS reports generator API

**Documents mentioned/used to perform some work/**

* Medical Report
* Lab order

## **Rationale to identify associations between conceptual classes** ##

An association is a relationship between instances of objects that indicates a relevant connection and that is worth of remembering, or it is derivable from the List of Common Associations: 

+ **_A_** is physically or logically part of **_B_**
+ **_A_** is physically or logically contained in/on **_B_**
+ **_A_** is a description for **_B_**
+ **_A_** known/logged/recorded/reported/captured in **_B_**
+ **_A_** uses or manages or owns **_B_**
+ **_A_** is related with a transaction (item) of **_B_**
+ etc.
