# US 012 - To record the results of a given test

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a clinical chemistry technologist, I intend to record the results of a given test



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	Each task is characterized by having a unique reference per organization, a designation, an informal and a technical description, an estimated duration and cost as well as the its classifying task category. 


>	As long as it is not published, access to the task is exclusive to the employees of the respective organization. 



**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** When the Clinical Chemistry Technologist wants to record the results of a test, how does he has access to that test? By internal code, NHS code?
>  
> **Answer:** Each sample has a unique barcode. The clinical chemistry technologist should use the sample barcode number to find the test for which the sample was collected.

-

> **Question:** Should the system present a result for each test parameter or a single result for the test to be recorded?
>  
> **Answer:** The Clinical Chemistry Technologist should register a value/result for each parameter of the test.



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The application should use an external module that is responsible for providing the test reference values.
* **AC2:** The application can use an external module for each type of test.
* **AC3:** The API request should include, at most: (i) a key to access the module; (ii) a parameter identifier; (iii) the reference date; and (iv) reference measurement unit.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US05 Record A New Sample" since at least one sample must be registered in the system, so that the results of its parameters can be compared with the reference values.


### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
	* result value, 
	* metric.

	
* Selected data:
	* test,
	* test parameter.


**Output Data:**

* List of tests.
* List of test parameters.
* (In)Success of the operation.

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

* The created task stays in a "not published" state in order to distinguish from "published" tasks.

### 3.1. Rationale

**SSD - Alternative 1 is adopted.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | RecordTestResultUI  |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | RecordTestResultController | Controller                             |
| Step 2  		 |		... knowing the tests to show?		 |      TestStore       |  IE and HC+LC: Owns the existing tests and prevents the Company from doing many things.                            |
|				 |	... knowing the TestStore?   |  Company  | IE: Company knows all its tests.
|                |	... process the data and convert it to dto  |  TestMapper   | DTO: It is used so that the UI cannot contact directly with the domain model.   	|
| Step 3  		 |
| Step 4  		 |	...knowing the test parameters to show? | Test  | IE: Test contains a list of test parameters. |
|				 | 	... process the data and convert it to dto  |  TestParameterMapper   | DTO: It is used so that the UI cannot contact directly with the domain model.   	|
| Step 5  		 |									|
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              
| Step 7  		 |  ... create a new instance of TestParameterResult?	| 	Test  |	Creator (R1): ?		|
|				 |  ... validating all data (local validation)? | TestParameterResult | IE: owns its data.|
|					 |   ... adapting the interface  | 				| Protected variations: Upgrade the adaptability of the system to new APIs with the same funcionalities |
| Step 8  		 |						| 
| Step 9 		 |   .. saving the test parameter result?	|  Test  | IE: knows all its test parameters.  |
|			 	 | ... validating all data (global validation)?	 | Test | IE: owns its data. |
| Step 10 		 | ...informing operation success |	RecordTestResultUI  |  IE: is responsible for user interactions.	|


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Company
 * TestParameterResult
 * Test

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * RecordTestResultUI  
 * RecordTestResultController
 * TestMapper
 * TestStore
 * TestParameterMapper

**From alternative 1**

# 4. Tests 

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Task instance = new Task(null, null, null, null, null, null, null);
	}
	

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with a reference containing less than five chars - AC2. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureReferenceMeetsAC2() {
		Category cat = new Category(10, "Category 10");
		
		Task instance = new Task("Ab1", "Task Description", "Informal Data", "Technical Data", 3, 3780, cat);
	}


*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)


## Class CreateTaskController 

		public boolean createTask(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Integer catId)() {
		
			Category cat = this.platform.getCategoryById(catId);
			
			Organization org;
			// ... (omitted)
			
			this.task = org.createTask(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			
			return (this.task != null);
		}


## Class Organization


		public Task createTask(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Category cat)() {
		
	
			Task task = new Task(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			if (this.validateTask(task))
				return task;
			return null;
		}



# 6. Integration and Demo 

* A new option on the Employee menu options was added.

* Some demo purposes some tasks are bootstrapped while system starts.


# 7. Observations

Platform and Organization classes are getting too many responsibilities due to IE pattern and, therefore, they are becoming huge and harder to maintain. 

Is there any way to avoid this to happen?
