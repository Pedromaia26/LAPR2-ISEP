# US 003 - To register a client  

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


As a medical lab technician, I want to record the samples collected in the scope of a given test



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

> "In case of a new client, the receptionist registers the client in the application. To register a client, the receptionist needs the clientï¿½s citizen card number, National Healthcare Service (NHS) number, birth date, sex, Tax Identification number (TIF), phone number, e-mail and name."




**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** "After being registered by the receptionist, should the client receive some kind of confirmation e-mail in order to finish his registration?"
>  
> **Answer:** "The client only receives an e-mail informing that the registration was successful and that he can start to use the system. The e-mail includes the client password." - [link: https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=7736#p10133]



### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria


* **AC1:** The system should support several barcode APIs. The API to use is defined by configuration



### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US004 Create a test to be registered" since at least a test must exist to record the sample.


### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**
	
* Selected data: Test.


**Output Data:**

* (In)Success of the operation

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Sample
 * Test
 * TestStore
 * TestDto
 * BarcodeAdapter

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * RecordSampleUI  
 * RecordSampleController

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

**From alternative 1**

![US005_CD](US005_CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Task instance = new Task(null, null, null, null, null, null, null);
	}
	

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Task class with a reference containing less than five chars - AC2. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureReferenceMeetsAC2() {
		Category cat = new Category(10, "Category 10");
		
		Task instance = new Task("Ab1", "Task Description", "Informal Data", "Technical Data", 3, 3780, cat);
	}


*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)


## Class CreateTaskController 

		public boolean createTask(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Integer catId)() {
		
			Category cat = this.platform.getCategoryById(catId);
			
			Organization org;
			// ... (omitted)
			
			this.task = org.createTask(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			
			return (this.task != null);
		}


## Class Organization


		public Task createTask(String ref, String designation, String informalDesc, 
			String technicalDesc, Integer duration, Double cost, Category cat)() {
		
	
			Task task = new Task(ref, designation, informalDesc, technicalDesc, duration, cost, cat);
			if (this.validateTask(task))
				return task;
			return null;
		}



# 6. Integration and Demo 

* A new option on the Employee menu options was added.

* Some demo purposes some tasks are bootstrapped while system starts.


# 7. Observations

Platform and Organization classes are getting too many responsibilities due to IE pattern and, therefore, they are becoming huge and harder to maintain. 

Is there any way to avoid this to happen?
